As your dedicated primary dental care provider in St. John's, our comprehensive approach focuses heavily on prevention, highly accurate diagnostic imaging, and utilizing conservative treatments for patients of every age.</p>
          <p className="mb-6">We firmly believe that preventing a dental problem is vastly superior to fixing one. By establishing a strong, routine relationship with our clinic, we can continuously monitor the minute changes in your oral health over time. From routine deep-cleaning examinations and vital oral cancer screenings to creating custom sports mouthguards and providing TMJ (jaw joint) therapy, our overarching goal is to catch potential problems when they are entirely microscopic.</p>
          <p className="mb-6">At Dr. Muller Dentistry, we are passionate about patient communication. We take the time to comprehensively educate our patients using high-definition intraoral cameras, allowing you to see exactly what we see on screen. We ensure you fully understand the current state of your oral health and exactly how best to care for it effectively at home.</p>
