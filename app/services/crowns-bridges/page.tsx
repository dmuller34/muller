          <p className="mb-6">When a tooth is severely damaged by deep decay, cracked by trauma, or completely missing, it can severely impact your ability to chew, speak, and smile with confidence. Crowns and bridges offer highly durable, incredibly natural-looking solutions to permanently restore both the structural function and aesthetic appearance of your teeth.</p>
          <p className="mb-6">A dental crown (sometimes traditionally referred to as a 'cap') is a custom-made, hollow artificial tooth that fits perfectly over a weakened or heavily filled tooth. It acts like a protective helmet, preventing the natural tooth underneath from fracturing while restoring its original shape and brilliant color. We often highly recommend crowns after a tooth has undergone a root canal to ensure it does not split under chewing pressure.</p>
          <p className="mb-6">A dental bridge is a beautiful and effective way to fill the gap left by one or more consecutively missing teeth. It is quite literally a 'bridge' formed by anchoring a false tooth (or teeth) between two protective crowns placed on the healthy adjacent teeth. At Dr. Muller Dentistry, we utilize state-of-the-art digital scanning and high-strength ceramics (like Zirconia and E-max) to craft crowns and bridges that are virtually indistinguishable from your natural teeth.</p>
