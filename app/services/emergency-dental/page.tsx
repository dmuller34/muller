Extreme swelling that affects breathing or swallowing is a critical medical emergency and warrants an immediate trip to the nearest hospital ER." } }, { "@type": "Question", "name": "What should I do immediately if my tooth gets knocked completely out?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Time is highly critical! Handle the tooth only by the crown (the top part), NEVER the root. Do not scrub it. Gently rinse it with water if dirty, and try your best to temporarily place it back into the socket. If that is impossible, keep it fully submerged in a small cup of milk or your own saliva, and rush to see us within 60 minutes for the highest chance of saving it." } }, { "@type": "Question", "name": "Should I go to the hospital emergency room for my toothache?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "In the vast majority of standard toothache cases, a hospital ER can only provide pain medication or temporary antibiotics; they do not have the tools to actually fix the tooth. You must see a dentist to properly resolve the underlying root cause. However, if your dental infection is causing severe, rapid swelling that impacts your ability to breathe, swallow, or see, you MUST go to the hospital ER immediately." } }, { "@type": "Question", "name": "How quickly can I be seen for a dental emergency?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "We actively build buffer time into our daily schedule specifically for emergency patients.

              Time is critical — the first 60 minutes are everything. Pick up the tooth by the <strong>crown only</strong> (the white part you see when you smile). <strong>Never touch the root.</strong> If it&apos;s dirty, rinse it gently under water for no more than 10 seconds — do not scrub it. Try to place it back into the socket and hold it in place by gently biting on a clean cloth. If you can&apos;t reinsert it, keep the tooth submerged in a small cup of <strong>cold milk</strong> or your own <strong>saliva</strong>. Do not let it dry out.

              Rinse your mouth gently with warm water to clean the area.

Save any broken pieces of tooth if you can find them. <strong>Avoid chewing on that side entirely.</strong> Take ibuprofen (Advil) for pain — <strong>never apply aspirin directly to the gum</strong> as it causes chemical burns.

              Severe Toothache
            </h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Rinse with warm salt water (half a teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water) to reduce bacteria and soothe the area. Take ibuprofen or acetaminophen as directed on the packaging. <strong>Do not place any painkiller directly on the gum tissue.</strong> If the pain is throbbing and keeps you awake, it likely indicates an infection inside the tooth that requires professional treatment — over-the-counter medicine will not fix the underlying cause. Avoid very hot, very cold, or sweet foods and drinks until you see us.

              Swelling or Abscess
            </h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              An abscess is a dental infection that has formed a pocket of pus, usually at the root of the tooth. You may see a small bump on the gum that looks like a pimple. Rinse with mild salt water several times a day to draw the infection toward the surface and reduce discomfort. Apply a cold compress to the outside of your face. <strong>Do not try to pop or drain the abscess yourself.</strong> If swelling is spreading rapidly, if you develop a fever, or if the swelling is making it difficult to breathe or swallow, <strong>go to the hospital emergency room immediately</strong> — this can be life-threatening.

              Lost Crown or Filling
            </h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              If a crown falls off, try to keep it safe and clean. You can temporarily place it back on the tooth using a small amount of denture adhesive or toothpaste — <strong>do not use superglue</strong>. If a filling has fallen out, you can place a small piece of sugar-free gum over the exposed cavity as a temporary cover. Avoid chewing on that side. This isn&apos;t as urgent as trauma, but you should still call us within a day or two to prevent further damage or infection.

            This is one of the most common questions we get, and the answer matters. In most dental emergencies, <strong>coming to us is faster and more effective than going to the ER</strong>. Hospital emergency rooms can prescribe painkillers and antibiotics, but they don&apos;t have dental chairs, dental x-ray machines, or the instruments needed to actually fix the tooth. You&apos;ll wait for hours and leave with a prescription — not a solution.

            At our clinic, we can diagnose the problem with digital x-rays, numb the area, perform emergency root canals, temporarily re-cement a crown, splint a loose tooth, drain an abscess, extract a tooth that can&apos;t be saved — and do it all in the same visit.
