            What Is a Root Canal?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-2">
            A root canal is a dental procedure that treats the inside of the
            tooth when the pulp (the soft tissue containing nerves and blood
            vessels) becomes infected or damaged. Instead of removing the tooth,
            we remove the infected pulp, clean and disinfect the root canals,
            then seal the tooth. This saves your natural tooth and relieves
            pain while preventing further infection.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-10 scroll-mt-16">
            Why You Might Need a Root Canal
          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-2">
            Root canal therapy is typically recommended when:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-muted-foreground space-y-1 mt-2">
            <li>Deep decay has reached the tooth pulp</li>
            <li>You have a cracked or chipped tooth that has exposed the pulp</li>
            <li>Repeated dental procedures on the same tooth have stressed the pulp</li>
            <li>You have severe sensitivity to hot or cold that doesn’t go away</li>
            <li>You experience persistent pain, swelling, or tenderness in the gums</li>
            <li>An abscess (infection) has developed at the root of the tooth</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Ignoring these signs can lead to worse pain, spread of infection,
            and possible tooth loss. Root canal therapy in St. John&apos;s at
            our practice helps you avoid extraction and keep your natural smile.

            Does a Root Canal Hurt?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-2">
            Modern root canal treatment is designed to relieve pain, not cause
            it. With proper anaesthesia, most patients experience little to no
            discomfort during the procedure. Any soreness afterward is usually
            mild and can be managed with over-the-counter pain relievers. We
            prioritize your comfort and will answer any questions you have about
            pain management.

            After Your Root Canal
          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-2">
            After root canal therapy, it’s important to:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-muted-foreground space-y-1 mt-2">
            <li>Avoid chewing on the treated tooth until it’s fully restored (e.g. with a crown)</li>
            <li>Follow any prescribed or recommended pain relief and care instructions</li>
            <li>Attend follow-up appointments and complete the restoration (crown) if recommended</li>
            <li>Maintain good oral hygiene and regular checkups</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
            A restored root-canaled tooth can last a lifetime with proper care.
